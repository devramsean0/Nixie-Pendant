## Some basic goals:
- 2 Nixie Tubes
- Fully self contained
- "Safe"
- Powered by a battery or USB

## Choosing a tube
I went for [IN-16](https://www.nixies.us/bwg_gallery/in16/) tubes, due to them being vertical.
They are also relatively affordable on Ebay.

IN-16 digits use 2mA and run at 170v, The dot uses .3mA.
These tubes have a diameter of 13mm.

## A rough 2D Design
I then set out to design the rough 2d (top down) shape in Figma.
This allowed me to plan out screw positioning and have a template for PCB shape
